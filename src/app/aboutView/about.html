      <p>Our goal is to provide a platform for sharing information about potentially dangerous routes that need to be rebolted and offer an easy way to donate to the cause.</p>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>Many of America's sports routes were bolted in the 80s and 90s by climbing visionaries living on the cheap.  A few dacades later many of these bolts have naturally weathered and rusted and need to be replaced.</p>
      <!-- <p><strong>During the 80s and 90s </strong>America went on a wonderful bolting spree.  Many climbers lived vagabond lifestyles migrating with the weather, scrounging for food, bolting king lines.  Back then it was the wildwest as to what hardware was used.  There are stories of climbers forging their own harware, using old bedframes as hangers, doing whatever they could to keep costs low enough to keep up the lifestyle. We are deeply indebted to these visionaries for making sport climbing what it is today.</p> -->
