        <p>During the 80s and 90s America went on a wonderful bolting spree.  Many climbers lived vagabond lifestyles migrating with the weather, scrounging for food, bolting king lines.  Back then it was the wildwest as to what hardware was used.  There are stories of climbers forging their own harware, using old bedframes as hangers, doing whatever they could to keep costs low enough to keep up the lifestyle. We are deeply indebted to these visionaries for making sport climbing what it is today.</p>

      <p>Now it is our turn to do our part.  This harware has been exposed to 30+ years of wind, rain, ice, top-ropers, and rock salts.  Many bolts are a tragedy in waiting that can be avoided if we step up, band together, and do something about it.</p>
      <p><strong>But what can I do?</strong>Not everyone has a 36V Bosh, but everyone has, $5, $10, $50 they can commit to their safety.  Do your part, donate to an area you crush at.  You'll send your project next go, I gaurantee it.</p>
